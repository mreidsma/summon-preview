# Summon Preview Usage

Last week I added a little preview banner to advertise Summon 2.0. After I launched it, it occured to me that I'd like to know how many folks see it, how many close it, how many try the preview, etc. Since I think Summon 1.0 and 2.0 both use the same Google Analytics, I wanted to isolate folks using 1.0, so I wrote this quick script to populate a CSV file. Maybe it will work for you.

### Installing

Open .htaccess and edit lines 3 and 10 to be the path to whereever you plan to put the script. Then upload all the files there.

### License

Use this script however you want, as long as it's for good and not evil.
